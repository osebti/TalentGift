In particular, we want to create a web application that facilitates stronger connections between managers, employees, and the organization as a whole by offering a wide range of user-friendly surveys that generate insightful statistical reports. These surveys serve as a guideline for both managers and employees in identifying their own strengths and weaknesses as well as enable managers to have a better understanding of their own crews. This will eventually lead to an improved workplace dynamic and productivity across the whole organization. Project Glossary Company GAP - A weighted percentage score representing how well a company is utilizing their employees.

Overall, he was satisfied with our work for Sprint 1. Sprint 2 Tasks We need to book another client meeting to go over Yohana's feedback on our user stories, and clarify how reports should look. This sprint seems quite heavy for the frontend people. The backend people should try to complete their tasks efficiently then provide assistance to the frontend people. SQL Tables Managers and employees are both considered Users in the database. For the codebase, we should create seperate classes/modules for managers and employees If a manager wishes to delete their account, they must also delete the organization they manage (this is an edge case). We agreed that statistics should be stored in the database rather than be recalculated every time a user accesses a report Action Items Member Tasks Alexander Nguyen Setup Cybera and GitHub actions, Sign In using Email Irene Sun JSX/CSS for taking surveys, REST API endpoints for taking surveys Jaskirat Singh Saggu REST API endpoints for creating surveys Leah Sheptycki JSX/CSS for login Othman Sebti Sign Up using Email Thea Nguyen JSX/CSS for taking surveys October 5, 2023, 9:00 am via Google Meet Agenda Clarification about user story feedback Discuss what content should be included in the reports Attendees Alexander Nguyen Irene Sun Jaskirat Singh Saggu Leah Sheptycki Othman Sebti Thea Nguyen Yohana Soto (Client) Minutes User Stories Allow the manager to upload info about the company (what kind of employees, name, email, id, position) What are the critical positions in the company (HR, accountants, etc.) Manager creates the company and uploads information about their employees (via Excel) Need to be able to process Excel sheets with names, emails, id, question answers (Yes/No). The client wants managers to be able to add many employees at once Employees cannot upload an Excel sheet Use the same survey for managers and employees (1 large survey) Need to be able to add/delete questions Users can change their answers Manager can create one survey Manager can ask another manager about an employee, share surveys Employees can apply for positions at a company based on their survey results After employees complete the survey, they are able to make a decision User stories need to be updated to reflect insights from today\u2019s meeting Key Steps for App: 1: Take a Survey 2: Get report 3: Make an action Reports 1 report for each user (company, employee, manager) Put users into groups based on answers Need to connect report to the surveys Graph information based on user answers (each user answer leads to a specific outcome, given on Excel sheet presented by client) Based on the manager\u2019s answers, the app will give a business strategy Each employee takes a survey and based on their answers, the app will show the positions employees would be a good fit for The app will show if an employee is aligned with the company\u2019s business strategy (through Venn diagram, Company GAP) Company GAP (numerical score -> percentage) = engage rate + fit rate + \u2026 (each variable has a weighting, some are more important than others) We will implement the Venn Diagram, but not the Radar Chart (to avoid overwhelming managers) Action Items Member Tasks Alexander Nguyen Setup Cybera and GitHub actions, Sign In using Email Irene Sun JSX/CSS for taking surveys, REST API endpoints for taking surveys Jaskirat Singh Saggu REST API endpoints for creating surveys Leah Sheptycki JSX/CSS for login Othman Sebti Sign Up using Email Thea Nguyen JSX/CSS for taking surveys October 9, 2023, 4:00 pm via Discord Agenda Go over work completed so far for Sprint 2 Create a ssl certification in Cybera (for HTTPS protocol) Attendees Alexander Nguyen Irene Sun Jaskirat Singh Saggu Leah Sheptycki Othman Sebti Thea Nguyen Minutes General We went over what has been completed for Sprint 2 and what still needs to be done Sprint tasks need to be split more evenly in future sprints.

We went over a couple minor revisions that need to be made for Sprint 2 (see Sprint 1 feedback on Discord). Sprint 2 Requirements Address all feedback from Sprint 1 and update the documentation so that it matches the current state of the project Be sure to add test cases (at least 1 for each module) Make sure the codebase is well documented (at minimum a header comment is needed for each file explaining what the file is for) For Sprint 2, UI tests are not a priority (they need to be present in Sprint 3, at least to some extent) Tech Stack Clarification There was a disagreement about what technologies should be used for the backend (Node.js + SQL queries VS Next.js + Prisma ORM) that we discussed We ultimately decided to use Node.js for our backend instead of Next.js which was originally proposed in Sprint 1. Irene\u2019s work (she used Next.js) needs to be refactored to use Node.js (Alex will work on this) We need a clear division between frontend and backend teams. Choose a team lead for each team.

These critical positions should be shown in the reports. In the report: Rename \"Goals\" to \"Personality\" Rename \"Values\" to \"Expectations\" We agreed that add/edit/delete questions is outside of the scope of the MVP. We need to primarily focus on implementing the reports at this stage Company Reports Yohana will share how to calculate company GAP in the next few days We will focus on implementing Questions 3, 8-11, and 13 in the \"Company\" sheet of the shared Excel file Users should be able to export reports as a PDF Action Items Member Tasks Alexander Nguyen Address feedback on add members, separate employee and manager dashboards Irene Sun Write UI tests, refactor frontend Jaskirat Singh Saggu Delete organization (frontend + backend) Leah Sheptycki Create profile page Othman Sebti Finish one time survey link, reset password November 8, 2023, 9:00 am CSC B-10 Agenda Go over expectations for Sprint 4 release Set up a PostgreSQL database on Cybera Attendees Alexander Nguyen Irene Sun Jaskirat Singh Saggu Steven Heung (TA) Minutes General Steven quickly went over what needs to be done for Sprint 4.

The 4 questions are similar for employees/managers, they are just worded differently Each question is rated on a scale of 1-5 The formula (Control + Support = Accountability + Influence) should equilibrate, but of course users may answer in a way that the formula will not equilibrate If the formula does not equilibrate, make recommendations to the manager Hide which topic/title the employee/manager are answering about (e.g. Span of Control) Company Reports and Survey Add questions to managers to determine which positions are critical for them (3 questions to determine if a position is critical or not). Add these questions to the Excel file template in the Add Members page Questions: This position has a critical impact in operational continuity and corporate strategic development. Highly specialized position requiring expertise in rare tools or processes; demands intensive internal training due to limited availability and high skill requirements in the market. Decisions impact company revenue, resource allocation, and area budgets; influence functional processes and business structure. Ask managers to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = basic position; 5 = highly critical position) Sum up all 3 answers: 10-15 = Highly Critical (Red Flag) 6-9 = Medium Critical (Yellow Flag) 1-5 = Basic Position (Green Flag) Show flag in the manager report for each position For our purposes, create 3 positions: HR Leader, Director, Receptionist General Create a profile page and have first/last name entered there Only managers should be able to see the Members page Send one-time link with survey notification (i.e. send as one email) 3 day duration on the link Notification sent by a button on the Survey page Yohana will not be available next Thursday.
